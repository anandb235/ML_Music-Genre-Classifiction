# ML_Music-Genre-Classifiction

In this music genre classification project, a classifier on audio files to predict its genre is developed.

This project uses the GTZAN music genre classification dataset.

### About the dataset:
The [GTZAN genre collection](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/gtzan) dataset was collected in 2000-2001. It consists of 1000 audio files each having 30 seconds duration. There are 10 classes ( 10 music genres) each containing 100 audio tracks. Each track is in .wav format. It contains audio files of the following 10 genres:

* Blues
* Classical
* Country
* Disco
* Hiphop
* Jazz
* Metal
* Pop
* Reggae
* Rock


### Approach

There are various methods to perform classification on this dataset. Some of these approaches are:

* Multiclass support vector machines
* K-means clustering
* K-nearest neighbors
* Convolutional neural networks

This project uses K-nearest neighbors algorithm because in various researches it has shown better results for this problem.
